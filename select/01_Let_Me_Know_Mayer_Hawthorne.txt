I'm a genuine man, don't tell me no lies
And I know that look that you show
Is just a disguise

So if you have been untrue
And you've been with someone new
Oh baby, just let me know
Yeah baby, just let me know
If I'm not your one man only, tell me so

I'm a logical man, don't want to play games
And I know that something is wrong
You're acting so strange

So if you have been untrue
And you've been with someone new
Oh baby, just let me know
Yeah baby, just let me know
If I'm not your one man only, tell me so

Well I'm a confident man, no jealous guy
But you know you're making it worse
Each day that goes by

So if you have been untrue
And you've been with someone new
Oh baby, just let me know
Yeah baby, just let me know
Cause if I found out for certain
That you've been out there flirting
Baby I can't take that hurting no more

Oh, I can't take no more
Darling let me know
